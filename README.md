honestly some sort of generative algebra would spruce this up
but this was overcomplicated from the start

Really was a quick test to see if I could make and style svgs in react,
    which was a success.

`./src/app/page.js` imports
    `./src/app/svg/wireframe.jsx`, which sets up the basic svg for
        `./src/app/svg/wireframe-lines.jsx` to render generated lines

the css styling stuff built into next.js is kinda awesome
